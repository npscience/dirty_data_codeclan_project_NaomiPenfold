* load in full raw data files from excel, inspect to understand contents
* understand analysis tasks and which columns this will require
* make a subset of raw data with the required data
* clean column names
* write subset to new csv as checkpoint (`bird_counts_raw.csv`) - at this point, no data changed (only column names).
* inspect subsetted data, make initial cleaning plan
