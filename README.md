# dirty_data_codeclan_project_NaomiPenfold
 
The Dirty Data project repository contains two different projects where I cleaned and analysed "messy data" as part of the Codeclan data course.

They form part of my public portfolio to demonstrate my skills in data cleaning and analysis, using R.

Please see the READMEs inside each project folder for more details about these projects:

* [Halloween candy data](/Halloween_candy_data)
* [Seabirds](/seabirds)
